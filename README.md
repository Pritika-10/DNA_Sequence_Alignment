## **Overview**  
The alignment of multiple DNA sequences is computationally intensive, often requiring significant processing power. However, by leveraging **crowdsourcing**, this task can be made more efficient. **Human-computing games** enable players to visually align sequences based on specific evaluation criteria, utilizing the human ability for pattern recognition, which can sometimes outperform heuristic algorithms.  

This projectâ€™s primary objective is to develop a game that facilitates the alignment of multiple DNA sequences. Alignments that score higher than those produced by heuristic algorithms are deemed significant and could contribute to genetic disease research, including studies on:  
- Cancer  
- Heart and Muscle Diseases  
- Metabolic Disorders  
- Brain, Nervous, and Sensory System Disorders  

By engaging with this game, players contribute to advancements in genetic research and, ultimately, to the betterment of humanity.
